# Flower Classifier

This repository hosts a Colab notebook which trains a model to recognise flowers from [Oxford's 102 Cateogry Flower Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html)

I use a convolutional neural network with cyclical learning rates in order to achieve an accuracy of 97.3% on the validation set. This far exceeds the 72.8% accuracy achieved with featurization approaches from the [original paper for this dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2008/Nilsback08/).
